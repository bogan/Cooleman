        <p>
            The Cooleman Ridge Parkcare Group conducts an ongoing Fire Survey. The main objective of the survey is to idenifiy all the animal species that occur or have occured on the ridge. This includes both planned and unplanned fires.

            These various fires have had a significant impact on the regeneration of the bush. Please see our <a href="fire.php">Fire</a> page for more information about the role fire plays on the ridge. The group aims to record the location of each of these fires so as to better understand the pattern of fire on the ridge and how fires have altered the ecology of the ridge.
