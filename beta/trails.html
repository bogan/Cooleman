        <p>
            The Cooleman Ridge Nature Reserve is lucky to be home to a wide variety of trails that are of local, regional and national significance.
        </p>

        <p>
            These trails serve a variety of purposes ranging from recreation (eg. walking, cycling, horse riding) to management (eg. weed spraying, fire control, etc).
        </p>

        <p>
            These trails play an important role for connecting the work of the group with the broader community through their recreational value.</p>
