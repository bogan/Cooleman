        <p>The group has made significant progress with rehabilitating the reserve but much work remains to be done.</p>

        <p>the achievements are not always obvious.</p>

        <p>
            The major achievments of the group are:

        <ul>
            <li>Significantly reduced the presence of weeds in the many of the keay areas on the ridge.</li>
            <li>Surveyed many of the significant aspects of the ridge</li>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The group has managed to make some major improvements to the ecology of the ridge. Native habit has been progressively replaced damaged errors. There is still a signficant amoun of work to be done.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Cooleman Ridge Nature Reserve is one of the more damaged but there still remain many good areas. These areas serve as the nucleus of the groups efforts to restore the ecology of the ridge.
