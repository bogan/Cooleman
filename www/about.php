They worked hard on planting, weeding, letter writing, fundraising, recruiting, documenting, collecting, surveying, etc.    </p>    <p>        These ladies have now been replaced by a new generation of volunteers who carry on their hard <a href="work">work</a> and vision.        The group has now grown to have 50 registered members that <a href="contribute">contribute</a> in various ways to the groups objectives, with an active core of members that regularly <a href="meetings">meet</a> and <a href="work">work</a> on the ridge.    </p>    <p>        The group is also comprised of many informal members that do not regularly attend group activities but  <a href="contribute">contribute</a> to the groups work by doing private work in their own way and in their own time.    </p>    <p>        If you want to find out more about the group, a great resource is to read some of the group's <a href="news">newsletters</a> which provide a more detailed account of the activities of the group over the years.    </p></div><div class="col-sm-2"></div><?php include 'footer.php'; ?>
