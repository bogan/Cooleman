        <h2>Areas</h2>

        <p>
            The group has defined several Group Areas. These areas are areas we work regularly work on a specific on the ridge as a group.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main purpose of the Group Areas area is to be the venue where one of a regularly monthly <a href="meetings#groupmeetings">group meetings</a> take place. The group rotates through the group areas and means that a group area is visited approximately 3 or 4 times a year, once per season.
        </p>

        <p>
            The groups has defined 5 main group areas:
        <ul>
            <li>Group Area Kathner</li>
            <li>Group Area Chauvel</li>
            <li>Group Area Daryl</li>
            <li>Group Area Lincon</li>
            <li>Group Area Namitjira</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The groups areas have been selected based on a variety of criteria. These include:
        <ul>
            <li>Ease of Access</li>
            <li>Ecological Value</li>
            <li>Work Value</li>
            <li>Visiblity to the broader community</li>
            <li>Reducing fuel loads and mitigating the impact of dangerous fires</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The Group Areas are an important part of the groups <a href="strategy.php">strategy</a> to rehabilitate the ridge. The main functions of the Group Work Areas include the following:

        <ul>

        <p>
            The group work areas have shown major improvements over the years, with some of the areas now being very close to their original state. The long term goal for the group work areas is to progessively expand them and link them with other group areas or with other <a href="individualareas.php">individual work areas</a>.
