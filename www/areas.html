        <h2>Areas</h2>

        <p>
            The Cooleman Ridge Parkcare Group has defined several special Group Areas on the ridge. The main purpose of these Group Areas is to be the venue for one of a regularly monthly <a href="#!meetings">group meetings</a>. The group rotates through each of these group areas approximately 2 or 3 times a year.
        </p>

        <p>
            The groups areas have been selected based on a variety of criteria. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>Ease of Access</li>
                <li>Ecological Value</li>
                <li>Work Value</li>
                <li>Community Visiblity</li>
                <li>Fuel Reduction Potential</li>
                <li>Equal Distribution</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The Group Areas are an important part of the groups <a href="!#strategy">strategy</a> to rehabilitate the ridge. The main functions of the Group Work Areas include the following:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Serve as the foundation and focus of the long term goal to restore the health of the ridge.
            </li>
            <li>
                Act as a reservoir of high quality biological diversity that forms the nuculeus of future regeneration expansion on the ridge.
            </li>
            <li>
                Act as showpieces of the what the ridge has to offer for both educational and inspirational purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow the group to focus on the areas that are most valuable and thus help in maximising the effectiveness the groups work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Demonstrate the effectiveness of the groups strategy at rehabilitating the ridge to its natural state.
            </li>
            <li>
                Promote the work of the group and thereby encourage other people to join the group in achieving its objectives.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The Group Areas were established shortly after the 2003 bushfires. The areas have now been visited many times over the years and have shown major improvements, with some of the areas now being very close to their original state. The long term goal for the Group Areas areas is to progressively expand them and then ultimately link them with other group areas to form a single large continuous area of high quality native vegetation.
