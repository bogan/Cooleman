        <h2>Blackberry Survey</h2>

        <p>
            The Cooleman Ridge Parkcare Group undertakes a blackberry survey. These blackberry bushers are surveyed mainly to allow the management of an eradication program.

        <p>
            Blackberry bushes are major weed on the ridge, particulary on the eastern end near Mt Arawang.
        </p>

        <p>
            The group notifies the Parks and Conservation Service and they organised for them to be sprayed as part of the annual blackberry control program.
