    <p>The views from the Ridge are arguably the best in Canberra. The lightly timbered hills and saddles of the Ridge form an attractive part of the backdrop to the city.</p>

    <p>There are two trig points (Mt Arawang and Cooleman) which afford splendid views as well as the 25th Anniversary Seat.</p>

    <p>There are also seats at the Kathner St Dam and the Old Dam.</p>

    <p>These are ideal spots for viewing and listening to wildlife and just contemplating nature.</p>
