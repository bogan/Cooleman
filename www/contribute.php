<h2>Contribute</h2>

<p>The Cooleman Ridge Parkcare Group needs your help!</p>

<p>
    The group is always looking for people to contribute to its work.
</p>

<p>
    We believe everybody can help the work the group does, no matter what their age, health, interest, skill-level or experience is.
</p>

<p>
    To contribute, you do not have to be a member or attend meetings.

    Nor do your contributions have to be regular, large or involve physical work.

    In fact, you don't even have to be on the ridge to help!

</p>

<p>
    Here are many other suggested ways for you to contribute the work of the group:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Weeding when you are simply out enjoying the ridge</li>
    <li>Propagating plants for future planting on the ridge</li>
    <li>Writing an article for our monthly <a href="news">newsletter</a></li>
    <li>Reporting interesting sightings of plants and animals found on the ridge to <a target="_blank" href="http://canberra.naturemapr.org">Canberra Nature Map</a></li>
    <li>Taking photos and sharing them with the group</li>
    <li>Collecting rubbish from the ridge</li>
    <li>Sharing your specialist knowledge about the ridge</li>
    <li>Improving the web site content, structure or graphics</li>
    <li>Donating money to help fund the groups activities</li>
    <li>Anything else you can think of!</li>
</ul>

<p> Your contribution will help no matter what size, frequency or form it takes. Every little bit helps!</p>

<p>If you would like to contribute to the group in some way, please <a href="contact">contact</a> us.</p>.

<!--p>By making a contribution in one area (eg. newsletters) you free another member to do something that you can't or don't want to do (e.g weeding).</p-->

<!--p>
    Many people help out while just 'doing something else' on the ridge like walking the dog.
