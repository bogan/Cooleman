        <h2>Ecology</h2>

        <p>
            Cooleman Ridge is an example of a grassy woodland ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p>
            This type of ecosystem is characterised by a mixture of open woods interspersed with grasses. Woodland is characterised by a low to medium dentisity of mediums sized trees which are clearly separated grasses.
        </p>

        <p>
            Grassy woodlands are an endangered ecosystem throughout Australia because they are often converted to grazing and/or urban development. There are very few high quality ones still exist in the Australian Capital Territory.

       <p>
            The ecology of Cooleman Ridge has been substantially altered since European Settlement and is one of the more damaged of Canberra's nature parks. Native vegetation was deliberately removed and exotic plants planted and has shifted towards a monoculture but the group aims to restore the diverstiy of the ridge.

        <p>
            The distribution of native vegetation cover on Cooleman Ridge varies all the way from the very poor to the very good. The pattern of this distibution however, strongly correlates with past usage patterns of the ridge. Those parts that have been largely untouched by humans remain in an almost natural state, while other parts that have been modified by humans are dominated by exotics.
