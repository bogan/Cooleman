        <h2>Hills</h2>

        <p>Cooleman Ridge is blessed to have a serious of significant hills. The reserve is distinctve among most other Canberra Nature Park Reserves in that instead of being dominated by one large peak, it is a long flat ridge line that is comprised of a series of separate gently rolling hills. This page is intended to give an overview of the significant hills that are present on the ridge.</p>

        <p>These are hills are important because they provide some of th best views found in the Canberra urban area, including not only views of the city itself but also view to the west over the Murrumbidge Valley to the Bullen, Tidbinbilla and Brindabella ranges in the background.</p>

        <p> The nature reserve is comprised of five distinct hills. From west to east seast to west they are Mr Arawang (753m), Reservoir Hill (734m), Sentry Box Hill (733m), Cooleman Trig (732m), One Tree Hill (703m) and Fence Post Hill (653m).</p>

        <p> Some of these hills have their own summit trails - Mt Arawang and Cooleman Trig. Please see our <a href="trails.php">Trails</a> page for more information.</p>

        <h3>Fence Post Hill</h3>

        <p>Blah blah</p>

        <h3>One Tree Hill</h3>

        <p>It has been named by the group simply on the basis that it is dominated by solitary Red Box.</p>

        <p>There is no formal trail to the summit but can easily be accessed by one of the nearby management trails.</p>

        <h3>Sentry Box</h3>

        <p>Sentry Box is a distinctive by often unvisited hill on the ridge.</p>

        <p>Sentry Box was named by the early settlers because it was used as a common lookout for the locals to watch over there stock.</p>

        <p>The summit is not identified by any significant marker.</p>

        <p>There is no formal walking trail to the summit but can easily be accessed from the Bicentennial Trail.</p>

        <h3>Reservoir Hill</h3>

        <p>Reservour Hill sits in the geographic centre of the Cooleman Ridge. It has been informally named by the group simple because of the small round reservoir found there.</p>

        <p>The summit is not identified with any marker but is easly accessed from nature trails.</p>

        <h3>Cooleman Trig</h3>

        <p>Cooleman Trig is the second highest hill in the reserver. It is named after the presence of the survey trigonometric station located on the summit - one of the two to be found on the ridge.</p>

        <p>The summit provides some of the best views available from the ridge. The summit is accessed via the Cooleman Trig Walking Trail.</p>

        <p>The northern slopes of the hill contain some of the best quality native areas on the ridge with a wide variety of native grasses and forbes. The southern slopes of the hill however are largely dominated by weeds such as Canary Grass and Wild Oats.</p>

        <p>
            The summit area is worked on once a year typically in October. The main focus of the work is to remove Euphorbia from the summit.
        </p>

        <h3>Mt Arawang</h3>

        <p>Mt Arawang is the tallest hill on Cooleman Ridge. It is a significant landmark and can be seen from many parts of Canberra.</p>

        <p>It has been the location of significant work by the group over the years including the planting of native trees and shrubs in the early history of the group. The summit area was extremely degraded when the group started work with large thickets of Scotch Thistle and Fleabane, Phalaris. Some of these weeds have been largely eliminated but much work still remains.</p>

        <h3>Fence Post Hill</h3>

        <p>Fence Post Hill is the smallest of the hills on Cooleman Ridge. This name has been given to the hill informally simply because of the distinctive fence post on its small summit.</p>
