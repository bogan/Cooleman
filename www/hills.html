        <h2>Hills</h2>

        <p>
            Cooleman Ridge is blessed to have a series of significant hills. The reserve is distinctive among most other Canberra Nature Park Reserves in that instead of being dominated by one large peak, it is a long flat ridge line that is comprised of a series of separate gently rolling hills. This page is intended to give an overview of the significant hills that are present on the ridge.

            These are hills are important because they provide some of th best views found in the Canberra urban area, including not only views of the city itself but also view to the west over the Murrumbidge Valley to the Bullen, Tidbinbilla and Brindabella ranges in the background.  Some of these hills have their own summit trails - Mt Arawang and Cooleman Trig. Please see our <a href="trails.php">Trails</a> page for more information.
