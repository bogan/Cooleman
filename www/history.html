        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>The group was formed in 1991 by three ladies - Bess Sledge, Pauline Lynga and Tina Nevins.

            The group has now grown to have 50 registered members that contribute in various ways with small but active core of members that regulary meet and work on the nature reserve.

            Cooleman Ridge has been grazed by sheep
            and cattle for over a hundred years and consequently has many exotic grasses
            and weeds. As part of 'Yarralumla' property, 1899 maps indicate open forest.
            Latterly it was part of the 'Cooleman' grazing property when it was sown
            with <i>Phalaris</i> pasture grass and fertilised. It has been part of Canberra
            Nature Park formally since 1993 but was a reserve before that.
