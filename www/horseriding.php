    <p>Horse riders can access the Ridge from Kathner St at the northern end, and through the horse paddocks near Mt Arawang at the southern end. The only route available to horse riders on Cooleman Ridge is along the <a href="https://www.bicentennialnationaltrail.com.au/">Bicentennial National Trail (BNT)</a>. The BNT was established for horse riders in 1988 and runs from Healesville in Victoria to Cooktown in Queensland.</p>

    <p>Horse riding is not permitted on the other walking/cycling tracks on the Ridge.</p>
