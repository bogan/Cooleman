			<name>Mt Arawang</name>
			<description><![CDATA[

        <p>Mt Arawang is the tallest hill on Cooleman Ridge. It is a significant landmark and can be seen from many parts of Canberra.</p>

        <p>It has been the location of significant work by the group over the years including the planting of native trees and shrubs in the early history of the group. The summit area was extremely degraded when the group started work with large thickets of Scotch Thistle and Fleabane, Phalaris. Some of these weeds have been largely eliminated but much work still remains.</p>]]></description>

			<name>Cooleman Trig</name>
			<description><![CDATA[

        <p>Cooleman Trig is the second highest hill in the reserver. It is named after the presence of the survey trigonometric station located on the summit - one of the two to be found on the ridge.</p>

        <p>The summit provides some of the best views available from the ridge. The summit is accessed via the Cooleman Trig Walking Trail.</p>

        <p>The northern slopes of the hill contain some of the best quality native areas on the ridge with a wide variety of native grasses and forbes. The southern slopes of the hill however are largely dominated by weeds such as Canary Grass and Wild Oats.</p>

        <p>
            The summit area is worked on once a year typically in October. The main focus of the work is to remove Euphorbia from the summit.
