            The group meets once a month for a group working party. The group works on one of our formally designated <a href="groupareas.php">group work areas</a>. The group will perform many various <a href="Ã¡ctivities.php">activities</a> (eg. weeding, surveying, photography etc) in accordance with our accepted <a href="strategy.php">strategy</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Group Meetings also have many other benefits such as exchanging information and a coup of tea and cake afterwards.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Group Meeting is normally held on the third Sunday of every month (except when there are public holidays such as Christmas or Easter). Please see our latest <a href="news.php">newsletter</a> for the specific details for the exact time and place for our next meeting.

        <p>
            The group holds an annual general meeting every October. The primary purpose of the meeting is to elect the <a href="organisation.php#structure">committee members</a> for the forthcoming year.
        </p>
