This strategy guides all the activities that the group performs on the ridge.</p><p>    The group believes that it is important that everybody who uses the ridge, whether a member or non member, understands this strategy.    This is because the work of the group is either poorly understood or even misunderstood by the broader community.    This lack of <span class="highlight">understanding</span> can do more harm than good and can undermine the work that the group does.</p><p>    Therefore the best may the general public can help the work the group does is to just be simply aware of work the group does, even if they do not directly or actively work in the group. This page is intended to better explain the what, why, when, who and how of the groups work.</p><h3>Method</h3><p>    The strategy of group to &quot;regenerate the bush&quot; is based on its own variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_regeneration#Bradley_method">Bradley Method</a>. The Bradley Method is popular amongst &quot;landcare&quot; groups and is now the de-facto standard for bush regeneration groups, such as the Cooleman Ridge Parkcare Group.</p><p>    The effectiveness of this method is proven and is now <span class="highlight">widely accepted</span> throughout Australian &quot;landcare&quot; groups as the most cost-effective method to regenerated the bush.</p><h3>Philosophy</h3><p>    The Bradley Method is based on a philopsophy that ...    a more <span class="highlight">&quot;natural&quot; rather than an &quot;artificial&quot;</span> approach to bush regeneration.  Mother Nature will typically do a much better job or regenerating the bush than humans will ever to. All she needs is a helping hand. The idea is to tap into the bushes natural tendency to regenerate.</p><p>    The Bradley Method is based on the belief that the Australia bush has a <span class="highlight">natural tendency to regenerate itself</span>. Natives are believed to be betterer adapted to the conditions of the Australian landscape and will eventually out compete exotics, whether humans help or not. If left alone, it will naturally regenerate itself, even it this process would take decades if not centuries.</p><p>    However, humans can great significantly <span class="highlight"><em>accelerate</em></span> the natural regeneration process. the idea is for humans to tap into this natural tendency of the bush to generate.</p><p>    Humans can work in <span class="highlight">partnership</span> with mother nature. The group works in a synergistic relationship with mother nature.</p><h3>Focus- Weeding</h3><p>    The most impart way humans can help accelerate the natural regeneration of the bush is by an intensive and targeted weeding plan. Bradley Method places a strong emphasis <span class="highlight">&quot;weeding over planting&quot;</span>. Planting is artificial but weeding is natural and that it is better to &quot;work with bush rather than against it&quot;.</p><p>    The idea is that it is better to remove <a href="weeds-new.php">weeds</a> than add plants.</p><p>    Weeding is certainly not seen as sexy or glamorous as planting and does not fit with the <span class="highlight">stereotypical</span> view of landcare groups being &quot;all about planting&quot;.</p><p>    The idea is that humans work in partnership with mother nature to help restore the bush.</p><p>    The effectiveness of the Bradley Method is however <span class="highlight">counter intuitive</span> to those unfamiliar with it and does not conform with the general publics stereotypical idea of landcare groups. Planting seems to be the obvious way of restoring native vegetation.</p><p>    Planting seems to be the <span class="highlight">intuitive</span> thing to do. If you want more native plants then simply plant more of them. Weeding is counterinstuitive.</p><p>    However, it is important to understand that it is not just a "idealistic" or "moral" statement, but also a highly practical one as well.</p><h3>Competition</h3>the main reason why weeding is prefered to planting is....<p>    The main factor that prevents the natural regeneration of the bush is the presence of weeds. Weeds prevent the natural regeneration of the bush in that &quot;compete&quot; for essential <span class="highlight">resources</span>  that allow natives to regenerate for their few potential. The three main resources that weeds compete for include:</p><ul>    <li>Light</li>    <li>Water </li>    <li>Nutrients</li></ul><p>    The main reason for weeding is that it removes <span class="highlight">competition</span> on natives and thereby allows them to maximise the use of these essential resources and they will generally thrive once the resources are released.    by removing competitors that prevent the bush from regenerating.</p><p>    Releasing resource has the following important natives. It</p><ul>    <li>Improved growth</li>    <li>Improve health (drought, disease or other disturbant)</li>    <li>Improved reproduction</li></ul><p>    Weeding is a process of <span class="highlight">&quot;creative destruction&quot;</span> where you can &quot;create&quot; natives by destroying &quot;exotics&quot;.</p><p>    Weeding release these valuable resources and thereby is a natural accelerant to regeneration, just a petrol is to a fire.</p></p><h3>Feedback</h3><p>    The main aim of the Bradley Method is to achieve feedback virtuous cycle of positive feedback between humans and nature.</p><p>    Humans help nature by removing weeds and nature helps humans by adding natives. Humans are therefore responsible for the exotics while nature is responsible for the natives.</p><p>    This partnership of weeding and regeneration <span class="highlight">reinforcing</span>  the other, with the removal of exotics helping the creation of natives which in turn helps with the decrease the amount of weeding, and so on.</p><p>    The <span class="highlight">speed of regeneration</span> may be slow at first but begins to accelarate rapidly as the relatively proportions of natives to exotics changes. The process can be slow at first (especially if the proportion of natives is low), but can rapidly accelerate as the balance shifts from exotics to natives. This means it gets easier and easier to achieve that same results, or alternatively achieve more and more  results with the same effort.</p><!--<p>--><!--Weeding therefore has <span class="highlight">twin benefits</span> - it not only decreases the exotics but also increasing the natives.--><!--</p>--><h3>Principles</h3><p>The Bradley Method is guided by three core principles.</p><ol>    <li>Weed the best areas first</li>    <li>Minimise disturbance</li>    <li>Don't overclear</li></ol><h3>Effectiveness</h3><p>    The effectivveness of the Bradley Method ..... Weeding is the most effective means to achieve the groups goals. Weeds are removed because doing so is the single <span class="highlight">most effective activity</span> of stimulating natural regeneration, and not simply because because &quot;weeds don't belong&quot;.</p><p>    It is believed that an hours weeding gives a much better return than an hours planting. This means that a well targeted and executed weeding strategy can achieve major results more cost effectively than an equivalent planting strategy.</p><p>    Weeding is often believed to be a futile activity because weeds will only grow back once removed. However, once a good native cover has been re-established, most weeds rarely re-enter a weeded area and when they are do they are few or weak.</p><p>    The group believes that a well <span class="highlight">designed</span> and executed weeding strategy can have a major impact on the regeneration of the bush. A weeding strategy must be designed correctly. A poorly designed strategy can be a waste of time.</p><p>    An area that is weeded properly will regenerate much faster than an area that is not weeded or an area that is &quot;artificially&quot; regenerated with direct plantings.</p><p>    It requires less time, energy and money to destroy than to create and this is the main reason why weeding is considered to be more cost effective than planting.</p><p>    The main advantages of weeding over planting are summarised in the following table:</p><table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">    <tr>        <th></th>        <th>Planting</th>        <th>Weeding</th>    </tr>    <tr>        <th>Time</th>        <td>High</td>        <td>Low</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <th>Energy</th>        <td>High</td>        <td>Low</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <th>Money</th>        <td>High</td>        <td>Low</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <th>Mortality</th>        <td>High</td>        <td>Low</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <th>Uniformity</th>        <td>High</td>        <td>Low</td>    </tr></table><p>Weeding has a much better &quot;return on investment&quot; than planting.</p><p>    Weeding has many <span class="highlight">secondary benefits</span> in addition to its role in stimulating native regeneration. These include benefits such as fuel reduction and improved recreational amenity.</p><h3>Application</h3><p>    Many major weeds our now largely extinct from the ridge and many are well on their way to be declaring them extinct.</p><!--<p>--><!--The main vehicle by which the the groups strategy to regenerate the bush is applied is the the creation of several <a href="groupareas.php">group areas</a> and <a href="individualareas.php">individual areas</a>.
