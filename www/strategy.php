<?php $title = 'About';	?><?php include 'header.php'; ?><h2>Strategy</h2><p>    The group has developed a broad strategy to achieve its goal of regenerating the bush on Cooleman Ridge.    This strategy guides all the <a href="work">work</a> that the group performs on the ridge.</p><!--p>    The group believes that it is important that everybody who uses the ridge, whether a member or non member, understands this strategy.    This is because the work of the group is either poorly understood or even misunderstood by the broader community.    This lack of <span class="highlight">understanding</span> can do more harm than good and can undermine the work that the group does.</p--><!--p>    Therefore the best may the general public can help the work the group does is to just be simply aware of work the group does, even if they do not directly or actively work in the group.</p--><p>    However, our work and the strategy that guides it is generally poorly understood or even misunderstood by the broader community.</p><p>    This page is intended to better explain the what, why, when, who and how of the groups work.</p><h3>Method</h3><p>    The groups strategy is based on our own variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_regeneration#Bradley_method">Bradley Method</a> of bush regeneration.</p><p>    The Bradley Method is popular amongst similar &quot;landcare&quot; groups that are trying to &quot;regenerate the bush&quot;.</p><p>    The effectiveness of this method is proven and is now <span class="highlight">widely accepted</span> as the most cost-effective method to regenerate the bush.    It has become the de-facto standard for bush regeneration groups throughout Australia.</p><h3>Philosophy</h3><!--p>    The philosophy of the Bradley Method is based on a more <span class="highlight">&quot;natural&quot; rather than an &quot;artificial&quot;</span> approach to bush regeneration.</p><p>    However, it is important to understand that this preference is not just a "idealistic" or "moral" statement but also a highly "practical" one as well.</p>    It maintains that "mother nature" will typically do a much better job of regenerating the bush than what humans will do using artificial methods.</p--><p>    The Bradley Method is based on the belief that the Australian bush has a <span class="highlight">natural tendency to regenerate itself</span>.</p><p>    This is because natives are generally better adapted to the conditions of the Australian landscape and will eventually out compete most exotics, whether humans help or not.    That is, if left alone, the bush will <em>naturally</em> regenerate itself, even it this process would take decades or centuries.</p><p>    However, humans can significantly <span class="highlight"><em>accelerate</em></span> this natural regeneration process.    The main idea of the Bradley Method is for humans to tap into this natural tendency of the bush to regenerate <em>itself</em> - all mother nature needs from us is a helping hand!</p><!--p>    Humans can work in <span class="highlight">partnership</span> with mother nature to help restore the bush. The group works in a synergistic relationship with mother nature.</p--><h3>Emphasis</h3><p>    The most important thing humans can do to help accelerate the natural regeneration of the bush is through an intensive and targeted weeding plan.    The Bradley Method places a strong emphasis of &quot;weeding over planting&quot;.</p><!--p>Planting is artificial but weeding is natural and that it is better to &quot;work with bush rather than against it&quot;.</p--><p>    However, this emphasis of weeding over planting is the single biggest misconception the general public has about bush regeneration in general and our group in particular.</p><p>    Bush regeneration is usually seen by the general public as being &quot;all about planting&quot;.    Also this emphasis does not fit with the <span class="highlight">stereotypical</span> view of &quot;landcare&quot; groups promoted by the media which portrays planting as being more sexy and glamorous than weeding.</p><p>    Furthermore, this emphasis on weeding is <span class="highlight">counter intuitive</span> to those unfamiliar with it.    Planting seems to be the more <span class="highlight">intuitive</span> way of restoring native vegetation.    That is, if you want more native plants then it seems obvious that we should just simply plant more of them.    <!--p>    Weeding is often believed to be a futile activity because weeds will only grow back once removed. However, once a good native cover has been re-established, most weeds rarely re-enter a weeded area and when they are do they are few or weak.</p--></p><h3>Rationale</h3><p>    The main reason why weeding is preferred to planting is that it removes competition preventing native vegetation from naturally regenerating itself.</p><p>    The main factor that prevents the natural regeneration of the bush is the presence of <em>competition</em> in the form of weeds    as they &quot;compete&quot; for essential <span class="highlight">resources</span> that allow natives to naturally regenerate to their full potential.</p><p>    The three main resources that weeds compete for include:</p><ul>    <li>Light</li>    <li>Water </li>    <li>Nutrients</li></ul><p>    The main reason for weeding therefore is that it simply removes this <span class="highlight">competition</span> on natives and thereby allows them to maximise their use of these essential resources.</p><p>    Removing competition releases the resources for the native plants to utilise and has the following important benefits to native vegetation:</p><ul>    <li>Improved growth</li>    <li>Improved health    <li>Improved resilience (ie. to droughts, storms or other disturbance)</li>    <li>Improved germination</li>    <li>Improved seeding</li></ul><p>    Weeding therefore significantly <em>accelerates</em> the natural regeneration of native vegetation and once competition for these scarce resources is removed, the bush typically thrives.</p><p>    Weeding can therefore be though of as is a natural &quot;accelerant&quot; to bush regeneration, just as petrol is an &quot;accelerant&quot; to fire.</p><!--p>    Weeding therefore is a counter intuitive process of <span class="highlight">&quot;creative destruction&quot;</span> whereby you can indirectly &quot;create&quot; natives by "destroying" exotics.</p--><h3>Effectiveness</h3><p>    The group believes that weeding is the single most cost effective way of stimulating natural regeneration.</p><p>    Specifically, weeding can achieve the same results more cost effectively than an equivalent planting strategy, or put another way, weeding gives a much better &quot;return on investment&quot; than planting.</p></p><p>    The idea is that it is more effective to &quot;remove&quot; <a href="weeds">exotics</a> (ie. weed) rather than &quot;add&quot; natives (ie. plant).</p><p>    We believe that an hours weeding gives a much better return than an hours planting, or alternatively, it is better to pull out 100 weeds than plant 100 trees.</p><!--p>    In general, it requires less time, energy and money to "destroy" than to "create".</p--><p>    The following table summarises the relative "costs" of planting over weeding to achieve the same level of bush regeneration:</p><table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">    <tr>        <th></th>        <th>Planting</th>        <th>Weeding</th>    </tr>    <tr>        <th>Time</th>        <td>High</td>        <td>Low</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <th>Energy</th>        <td>High</td>        <td>Low</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <th>Money</th>        <td>High</td>        <td>Low</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <th>Mortality</th>        <td>High</td>        <td>Low</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <th>Uniformity</th>        <td>High</td>        <td>Low</td>    </tr></table><p>    Or in other words, weeding is a &quot;low cost, high return&quot; activity whereas planting is a &quot;high cost, low return&quot; one.</p><p>    Furthermore, weeding has many <span class="highlight">secondary benefits</span> in addition to its role in stimulating native regeneration. These include benefits such as fuel reduction and improved recreational amenity.</p><!--h3>Principles</h3><p>A good weeding strategy is better than a bad one. Not all weeding programs are effective. Some are much better than others.</p><p>    The group believes that a well <span class="highlight">designed</span> and executed weeding strategy can have a major impact on the regeneration of the bush.</p><p>    A weeding strategy must be designed correctly. A poorly designed strategy can be a waste of time.</p><p>    An area that is weeded properly will regenerate much faster than an area that is not weeded or an area that is &quot;artificially&quot; regenerated with direct plantings.<p>A good weeding strategy is based on the following three core principles of the Bradley Method.</p><ol>    <li>Weed the best areas first</li>    <li>Minimise disturbance</li>    <li>Don't overclear</li></ol--><!--h3>Progress</h3><p>    The main aim of the Bradley Method is to achieve feedback virtuous cycle of positive feedback between humans and nature.</p><p>    Humans help nature by removing weeds and nature helps humans by adding natives. Humans are therefore responsible for the exotics while nature is responsible for the natives.</p><p>    This partnership of weeding and regeneration <span class="highlight">reinforcing</span> the other, with the removal of exotics helping the creation of natives which in turn helps with the decrease the amount of weeding, and so on.</p><p>    The <span class="highlight">speed of regeneration</span> may be slow at first (especially if the proportion of natives is low), but begins to accelerate rapidly as the relative proportions shifts from exotics to natives.</p><p>    This means it gets easier and easier to achieve the same results over time, or alternatively achieve more and more results with the same effort.</p--><!--<p>--><!--Weeding therefore has <span class="highlight">twin benefits</span> - it not only decreases the exotics but also increasing the natives.--><!--</p>--><!--h3>Application</h3><p>    Many major weeds our now largely extinct from the ridge and many are well on their way to be declaring them extinct.</p--><!--<p>--><!--The main vehicle by which the the groups strategy to regenerate the bush is applied is the the creation of several <a href="groupareas">group areas</a> and <a href="individualareas">individual areas</a>.
