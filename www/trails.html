        <h2>Trails</h2>

        <p>The Cooleman Ridge Nature Reserve is lucky to be home to a wide variety of tracks that are of local, regional and national significance.</p>

        <p>These various trails serve a variety of purposes ranging from recreation (eg. walking, cycling, horse riding) to management (eg. weed spraying, fire control, etc).</p>

        <p>
            These trails play an important role for connecting the work of the group with the broader community through their recreational value.</p>
