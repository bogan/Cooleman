        <h2>Water</h2>

        <p>Water is an important part of the ecology of Cooleman Ridge. Unfortunately, water is one feature of the ridge that is not very common with little in the way of permanent natural water sources. There are however, some significant aspects to water including the following.</p>

        <h3>Creeks</h3>

        <p>Cooleman Ridge is the headwaters for four creeks.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bulgar Creek</strong> - located on the north west of the ridge and flows to the Murrumbidgee River.</li>
            <li><strong>Weston Creek</strong> - located on the north east side of the ridge and flows into the Molonglo River.</li>
            <li><strong>Village Creek</strong> - located on the the south east end of the ridge and flows into Lake Tuggeranong.</li>
            <li><strong>New Station Creek</strong> - located on the south west edge of the ridge and flows into the Murrumbidge River.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are no permanent water courses found on the ridge. The creeks are intermittent and only flow for a short time after heavy rain.</p>

        <h3>Dams</h3>

        <p>
            Cooleman Ridge has three dams:

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Kathner Street Dam</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The Old Dam</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The Dry Dam</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These dams were created principally to support cattle grazing on the ridge, either prior to the ridge becoming a reserve (eg. The Old Dam and Dry Dams) or after it (e.g. Kathner Street Dam). A secondary reason for their creation was to help in firefighting in the event of a fire occuring on the ridge.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main role these dams serve today is to act as artificial wetlands. They provide important habitats for various aquatic species including fish, frogs, ducks, turtles and insects. They play an important role in preserving the biodiversity of the ridge.
        </p>

        <p>
            These dams are a major focus of the work that group does as they provide both important environmental and recreational benefits.
        </p>

        <p>
            These dams are the focus of our Dam Survey which provides a photographic record of the dams over several years. Please see our <a href="dams.php">Dam Survey</a> page for more details.

        <h4>Kathner Street Dam</h4>

        <p>
            The Kathner Street Dam is located on the headwaters of Bulgar Creak on the north western edge of the ridge. It is easily accessed from the Kathner Street entrance to the reserve. The dam is of a medium size.
        </p>



        <p>
            The water in the dam is sourced from one of the small tributaries of the Bulgar Creek. The flow of water is also supplemented by the flow of water comming from the stormwater drain located further upstream. running along the management trail on the north western slopes of the ridge, which can significantly increase the water supply to the dam.</p>

        <p>
            The water level in the dam fluctuates quickly from completely full to completely empty, but most of the time there is some signficant water contained in.
        </p>

        <p>
            The dam is the focus of a lot of the work that the group performs. The dam is part of one of the groups Group Work Areas and is visited several times a year as part of its Monthly meeting, but also the main focus of one of the groups special area groups. The friday work group.
        </p>

        <p>
            The dam and its immediate environs have seen significant improvement over the years. Many weeds have been eliminated resulting increase in many native species that grow in wet areas such as reeds and rushes. The main work that still remains to be performed is the removal of the remaining pasture grasses from the drain line. Erosion control is also an important part of the work performs on this dam. The group has created man
        </p>

        <p>
            The dam now provides extra facilities that have been ordangised by the group. These include a bench that is now a popular spot for the community to stop and observe the dam and its wildlife. The dam has also contained a bird platform created and maintained by the group. The platform was useful in allowing birds to nest.
        </p>

        <h4>Old Dam</h4>

        <p>
            The Old Dam is located on the headwaters of New Station Creek on the south western slopes of the ridge. It is the largest dam on the ridge.
        </p>

        <p>
            The dam was created when the ridge was a pastoral property to provide water to cattle and sheep.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Old Dam is named simply because it was created before the &quot;newer&quot; Kathner Street Dam. It was created before the formation of the group by the former owners of the pastoral property.
        </p>

        <p>
            The dam is fed by one of the tributaries of New Station Creek. The watershed for this dam is also the largest of the dams on the ridge and it is therefore almost always contains at least water, even in times of drought.
        </p>

        <p>
            The dam contains a bench which was organised by the group.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Old Dam was a major focus of the groups early work in the 1990s with many working parties held there. The group removed many weeds and planted many trees to provide habitat and improve the visual appeal of the dam. The dam is not now regularly worked on.
        </p>

        <p>
            The dam is important habitat for many acquatic species that are not found anywhere else on the ridge such as turtles and frogs.
        </p>

        <h4>Dry Dam</h4>

        <p>The Dry Dam is located on the south eastern of the ridge on the south western slopes of Mt Arawang.</p>

        <p>The Dry Dam is named so simply because it is nearly always now dry.

        <p>The dam was created when the ridge was a pastoral property to provide water to cattle and sheep.</p>

        <p>The dam is effectively abandoned and derelict. The group hopes to one day restore this dam to provide important habitat on the southern and eastern parts of the ridge.</p>

        <p>The dam can be accessed from the Bicentennial Trail.</p>

        <p>The dam was supplied with water shedding from the south western slopes of Mt Arawang.</p>

        <h3>Stormwater</h3>

        <p>The north western slopes are traversed by a large storm water cut off drain. The main purpose of this drain is to prevent excess water runoff from the ridge into the houses belows the ridge in the adjacent suburbs of Kambah and Chapman.</p>

            </p>

            <p>People say: "There is a dam at the Kathner Street entrance!". Nobody asks:
                "Why is there a dam at the Kathner Street entrance?". Iâ€™ll tell you </p>

            <p>Long ago, in the early 1990s a ParkCare group was formed to take care
                of the native vegetation on Cooleman Ridge. Keen volunteers led by the indomitable
                Bess Sledge proceeded to plant natives, weed exotics and study the multitude
                of plant species.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="Dry dam, 27 August 2004" src="../images/dam/270804.jpg" style="float:left;margin:10px;width:250px">
                At the same time there was a drive to utilise Cooleman Ridge for cattle
                grazing for fuel reduction and also to provide a water supply for fire fighting
                vehicles in the event of a wildfire. For these purposes a dam had to be
                constructed. The ParkCare volunteers were not happy about cows trampling
                natives and spreading weeds, so they were at that time not happy about the
                dam but it seemed impossible to stop the construction. As a consolation
                the group got a barbed wire fence to enclose an area into which cattle could
                not enter. ParkCare activities as well as the need for fire prevention could
                be accommodated on Cooleman Ridge.</p>

            <p>Time passed, the cattle grazing took place in another part of Cooleman
                Ridge where there was another dam. The Kathner Street dam slowly filled
                with water and attracted birds, fish, frogs and yabbies. It became a feature
                liked by both walkers and parkcarers, who could enjoy a peaceful rest on
                the bench listening to the quaking of the frogs and admiring the proud ducks
                with their broods of fast pedalling ducklings.</p>

            <p>So, the group rather than considering the dam as an intrusion developed
                a feeling of ownership of the dam and decided to build a platform for the
                birds. GÃ¶sta LyngÃ¥ got the task of building it and of swimming out to anchor
                it in the middle of the dam. There was now more to look at and enjoy when
                relaxing on that bench.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="Full dam, 11 July 2012" src="../images/dam/110712.jpg" style="float:right;margin:10px;width:250px">
                However, the rainfall is not reliable and one day the dam was a dry hole
                with a bird platform in the middle of it. Throughout the years the water
                level in the dam has been varying between complete dryness like in August
                2004 and a good amount of water as most of the time afterwards.</p>

            <p>
                On the dam wall a number of trees took root and were believed to cause
                leakage from the dam. The views of the ParkCare group members has now been
                dominated by a wish to save the dam from leakage, so the trees have been
                taken down and now the dam is better filled than at any time before. This
                photo is from 11 July 2012.</p>

            <p>A series of almost <a href="dam/2004.php">300 photos of the dam</a> between 2003 and 2012 have been
                taken by Pauline and GÃ¶sta LyngÃ¥. Unfortunately, photos taken before
                January 2003 were destroyed in a bushfire. The photographic survey of the
                dam is continued by Arminel and Pat Ryan. </p>

            <p>The Kathner Street dam is now the subject of regular Water Watch studies
                and enjoyed by wildlife as well as by visitors, particularly when a multitude
                of frogs give their evening concerts. </p>
