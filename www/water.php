    <!--<p>Water is an important part of the ecology of Cooleman Ridge. Unfortunately, water is one feature of the ridge that is not very common with little in the way of permanent natural water sources.</p>-->

    <p>Cooleman Ridge has various water features within its boundaries including watercourses, reservoirs and dams.

    <h3 id="headwaters">Headwaters</h3>

    <p>Cooleman Ridge is the headwaters for four creeks.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The northwest aspect of the ridge drains into Bulgar Creek.</li>
        <li>The southwest aspect of the ridge drains into New Station Creek.</li>
        Both the above creeks drain into the Murrumbidgee River.
        <li>The northeast aspect of the ridge drains into Weston Creek, and thence the Molonglo River.</li>
        <li>The southeast aspect of the ridge drains into Lake Tuggeranong.</ul>
    </li>

    <!--<ul>
        <li><strong>Bulgar Creek</strong> - located on the north west of the ridge and flows to the Murrumbidgee River.</li>
        <li><strong>Weston Creek</strong> - located on the north east side of the ridge and flows into the Molonglo River.</li>
        <li><strong>Village Creek</strong> - located on the the south east end of the ridge and flows into Lake Tuggeranong.</li>
        <li><strong>New Station Creek</strong> - located on the south west edge of the ridge and flows into the Murrumbidgee River.</li>
    </ul>
-->
    <p>There are no permanent water courses found on the ridge. The creeks are intermittent and only flow for a short time after heavy rain.</p>

    <h3 id="dams">Dams</h3>

    <p>Cooleman Rige has two dams located within its boundaries - the Kathner St Dam and the Old Dam.</p>

  <!--  <p>
        These dams were created principally to support cattle grazing on the ridge, either prior to the ridge becoming a reserve (eg. The Old Dam and Dry Dams) or after it (e.g. Kathner Street Dam). A secondary reason for their creation was to help in firefighting in the event of a fire occuring on the ridge.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main role these dams serve today is to act as artificial wetlands. They provide important habitats for various aquatic species including fish, frogs, ducks, turtles and insects. They play an important role in preserving the biodiversity of the ridge.
    </p>

    <p>
        These dams are a major focus of the work that group does as they provide both important environmental and recreational benefits.
    </p>

    <p>
        These dams are the focus of our Dam Survey which provides a photographic record of the dams over several years. Please see our <a href="dam-survey">Dam Survey</a> page for more details.
    </p>-->

    <h4>Kathner St Dam</h4>

    <p>Kathner St Dam is found just inside the northern entrance.</p>

    <p>At the same time as the Group was formed in the early 1990s, there was a drive to utilise Cooleman Ridge for
        cattle grazing for fuel reduction. The cattle would need a water supply, as would fire fighting vehicles in the
        event of a bushfire. For these purposes a dam needed to be constructed.</p>

    <p>The Group was not happy about cattle trampling native plants and spreading weeds, so they opposed the dam’s
        construction. However, as a compromise, a barbed wire fence was installed to enclose an area into which cattle
        could not enter.</p>

    <p>Over time, cattle grazing moved to another part of the Ridge where there was another dam, the Old Dam. The
        Kathner Street dam slowly filled and attracted birds, fish, frogs and yabbies. It became a feature of the Ridge
        where people could enjoy a peaceful rest on the bench listening to and watching the wildlife.</p>

    <p>So, the Group, rather than considering the dam an intrusion, developed a feeling of ownership. It decided to
        build a platform for the birds. Gösta Lyngå got the task of building it and of swimming out to anchor it in the
        middle of the dam.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>A number of trees took root on the dam wall and were believed to cause water leakage. The problem was solved by
        the removal of the trees.</p>

    <p>In February 2021 a new and more comfortable seat was installed at the dam.</p>

    <p>A series of almost 300 photos of the dam between 2003 and 2012 were taken by Pauline and Gösta Lyngå.</p>

    <h4>Old Dam</h4>

    <p>Old Dam is about 1 km south of the Kathner St
        entrance on the Bicentennial Trail.</p>

    <p>This dam was included in the reserve boundaries when the reserve was first established in 1991. At that stage,
        cattle were still allowed to graze on the ridge in order to reduce fuel load, and this dam was their main source
        of water.<p/>

    <p>After the 2003 fires, intermittent cattle herds were grazed regularly along the now-fenced Bicentennial Nature
        Trail, and they continued to affect the dam with their hooves and manure. In 2018 the Parks and Conservation
        Service erected a fence around the dam to prevent cattle access, and it is now showing signs of recovery. Some
        planting has been done around the perimeter to provide habitat for birds and animals, and a new seat provides
        comfortable viewing of dam activities.</p>

    <h3 id="reservoirs">Reservoirs</h3>

    <p>Icon Water operates and maintains 48 reservoir sites in the four water distribution zones around Canberra. Two of
        these reservoirs are on the Ridge. One is the octagonal structure close to Darrell Place and the other is the
        round one up the hill from Guinness Place. Within the latter site is an Optus mobile telephone tower. The
        octagonal structure supplies mainly Rivett and the round one covers Chapman and upper areas of Fisher.</p>

    <p>They use a gravity feed system of distribution. Both reservoirs are supplied from the water treatment plant on Mt
        Stromlo. Some 25 pump stations distribute water around Canberra with most of it going through the Mt Stromlo
        facility which does a little ‘polishing’ or removal of microbiological organisms that may be present. Also there
        is some chlorination of water to remove contaminants that may be taken up in the journey from water treatment
        plant to householders’ taps. </p>

    <p>People may recall the water supply issues resulting from the de-roofing of the
        round reservoir and subsequent contamination of its contents during the January 2003 fire. Chapman and Fisher
        residents were advised not to drink the water. ACTEW supplied bottled water in the interim. Also, water supply
        from the octagonal reservoir was affected because power was down. A generator was brought in to maintain
        supply.</p>

    <h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>

    <p>A member of the CRPCG tests the water quality of the Kathner and Old on a monthly basis, and sends the results in to the
        <a href="https://www.act.waterwatch.org.au/">Waterwatch</a> database.</p>

    <p>This data reflects the health of the catchment area, which can be affected by changes in
        vegetation, erosion, animal activity or weather.</p>

    <h3 id="erosion">Erosion</h3>
    
    <p>Cooleman Ridge suffers from little erosion except on the main vehicle tracks, some of which are quite steep and
        therefore are prone to heavy water run-off. These tracks are repaired when funding allows.</p>

    <p>In 2007 a huge deluge on the Ridge flooded some of the houses in Chapman. As a result, the cut-drain was
        installed so that the water is safely diverted in the future.</p>
